In a latest N2 robbery, a woman in her 60s has been injured after a robbery on the N2 North Bound near Lamontville on Wednesday morning. Rescue Care Paramedics arrived on the scene just after 08:45am to find the lady had been injured after being assaulted during a robbery. It is alleged that the vehicle had run out of petrol and whilst the driver had gone to buy petrol two men came from the bush and broke the passenger window with a brick, they then robbed the lady of valuables before fleeing the scene. The patient was stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital for the further care that she required.SOURCE: RESCUE CARE
