They wore JMPD uniforms and drove three unmarked cars: a white Volkswagen Polo, silver Ford Ranger, and white BMW.Longwe said national police intelligence informed JMPD about the hijacking. The members of the dog squad stopped the hijacked truck and three accompanying vehicles at the Grasmere offramp, he said.The occupants of the Ford and BMW got away. Five men were taken to the Lenasia South police station and would appear in court soon.Longwe confirmed that two of the five were allegedly involved in the heist at the airport on March 7, during which millions of rands were stolen.Longwe did not want to release their names as they had not appeared in court yet in connection with the latest heist.Last month, Kempton Park Magistrate Amukelani Msimeki released Philokuhle Ntanzi, Prince Raphael Dube, Thando Sonqishe, France Manaka, Simon Thlokwane, Sibusiso Mnisi and Mosiwa Mutame on bail in the OR Tambo case.
