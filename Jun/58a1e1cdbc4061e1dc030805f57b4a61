The Springs Magistrate&#8217;s Court heard on Monday that a key witness told police that Former Eskom employee Thembisile Yende was killed because she &#8220;knew too much&#8221;.According to the witness, Yende was going to expose murder accused, David Ngwenya&#8217;s illegal dealings in copper. It is believed that the murdered woman was going to inform Eskom managers about Ngwenya&#8217;s activities. Yende was reportedly missing for nearly two weeks before her body was found in her office at an Eskom power station in Springs in May.The man allegedly injected Yende with a drug that weakened her, Investigating officer Christo Lotz said. She was then beaten and strangled. Her body was later dumped in a storeroom to make it seem as if Yende committed suicide.&#8220;Ngwenya was with two other men who assisted him and for whom the police are still looking. He contacted them warning them that their secret was no longer safe and that Yende must be killed,&#8221; Lotz told the court on Monday. Ngwenya&#8217;s bail application has been postponed.
