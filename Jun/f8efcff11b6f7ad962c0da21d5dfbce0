KZN Emergency officials are on the scene of a major crash on the N2, Southbound, opposite Westwood Mall. Four people have died and at least 12 others left with moderate to critical injuries, after a minibus taxi collided with a truck. Netcare 911&#8217;s Chris Botha says two passengers are critically injured. &#8220;We&#8217;re standing at a very horrific accident on the N2 south before Spaghetti Junction where a taxi hit the back of a truck. At the moment, we have four people that died at the scene. Another 12 has been injured. &#8220;The fire department and rescue unit are using the Jaws of Life to extricate people. The helicopter from EMRS has just landed at the scene to transport some of those injured,&#8221; he says. Botha says it&#8217;s believed the taxi involved in the crash was transporting off-duty nurses, from work.
