A mother and father have escaped jail terms because the twin babies they were convicted of being accessories to their attempted murder and serious assault needs them. The twins, referred to in court as Baby J and Baby M, were assaulted allegedly by both parents. Seriously injured Baby J was rushed to hospital on the Christmas morning of 2012.He later suffered permanent brain damage from severe head injuries sustained during the assault. His sister Baby M suffered several fractured ribs. On Monday, North Gauteng High Court Judge Eben Jordaan handed down a five-year prison sentence, wholly suspended, of which three years will be spent under correctional supervision, to the convicted parents. During sentencing proceedings the court heard that Baby J will never be able to lead a normal life and will always need critical and permanent care.Baby J requires constant care for life as a result, he is unable to walk, stand or crawl. He is unable to talk and just makes noises, a language only his mother has mastered, making her his best possible caregiver.He can also not eat on his own as he can t chew and cannot swallow properly, which makes him very prone to choking.Jordaan also noted that he had a minimal to zero immune system and would need 24-hour care, seven days a week.While the twins are now in the care of their maternal grandparents, their 26-year-old mother lives with them and provides them with care, with her being the primary caregiver of Baby J.Jordaan said the relationship between the mother and the twins was good and said she could understand what Baby J wanted from the noises he made.The court also heard that the 28-year-old father had a permanent job and was providing financial support to the care of the children.The State argued for a prison sentence as both accused had failed to take responsibility or show remorse. Jordaan agreed the attack on the twins was horrific, he however took into account the children&#8217;s welfare before deciding on an appropriate sentence.Both parents denied assaulting the toddlers during the trial.
