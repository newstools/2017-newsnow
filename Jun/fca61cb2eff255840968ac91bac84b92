Malvern SAPS Corporate Communications Officer Radhika Marimuthu stated, The matter is following due process with the evidence presented at the crime scene. A case of murder has been registered and is being investigated, said Marimuthu.A resident who did not agree with the arrest of the homeowner and considered the shooting to be an act of self defence, took to social media to vent their feelings shortly after the incident. Is this not a case of police members being over-zealous? A man just protected his family in an incident which was undoubtedly extremely traumatic for him and his family! We all know what results out of the majority of these types of home invasions Rape, murder and serious assault. And now the resident is lying in a cold cell with no access to trauma debriefers,? </em> said the anonymous community member.SOURCE: TABLOID
