Rogue landlords are exploiting vulnerable people by offering free accommodation in exchange for sex, charities have warned.They say the deals take advantage of those unable to afford spiraling rents and &#8220;go as close to the edge of the law without breaking [it]&#8221;.Websites hosting adverts for such offers are being urged to tackle the problem. As young people and the low-paid are priced out of accommodation, particularly in south-east England, &#8220;sex for rent&#8221; adverts have sprung up online.One classified advertising site, Craigslist carried more than 100 such listings in a single day, a BBC investigation found.A female student who answered one of them said she felt it was her only option.She added: &#8220;He took me into his living room, got me drinks, and then after that it was just straight upstairs He would do what he wanted, forcefully, and I just sort of went along with it.&#8221;Labour MP Peter Kyle said classified websites should stop allowing the adverts or Parliament should intervene.&#8220;If [websites] don t stand up to this and then accept their responsibility, I will be pushing for legislation to do it for them,&#8221; he said.A string of charities have backed his calls for a crackdown.Mel Potter, of the Brighton Oasis Project for women, said: &#8220;It s something that potentially can trap someone and put them at risk of violence and abuse. Andrew Wallis, of anti-slavery charity Unseen, added: &#8220;I think these adverts go as close to the edge of the law that they possibly can without breaking the law.&#8220;The [landlords] would argue they [tenants] have chosen voluntarily to enter that situation. The trouble is when you have a vulnerable person who then becomes exploited, the concept of choice soon disappears.&#8221;Paul Noblet, of homeless charity Centrepoint, called for advertising sites to consider a &#8220;voluntary code&#8221; under which the offending posts could be removed.One of the adverts on Craigslist, from the owner of a &#8220;small two-bedroom house near Hull&#8221;, says: &#8220;Money is not an issue, I would prefer some company.&#8220;There are some stipulations to the living arrangements This would be a mutual benefits arrangement. Free rent, paid in other methods.&#8221;Meanwhile, a &#8220;City worker&#8221; living in a luxurious spacious apartment in central London was seeking a dominant attractive woman who in return will place me beneath her beautiful feet and boss me around .The 35-year-old asked anyone interested to send photos of themselves and their &#8220;lovely feet&#8221;.Other adverts included a man in Maidstone, Kent, seeking a woman to move in and pretend to be his girlfriend.A double room in Rochester, Kent, was said to be available in exchange for unspecified &#8220;services&#8221;, while younger men were targeted by a post from a Brighton property owner. An &#8220;open-minded naughty sexy girl&#8221; was requested by a London landlord, who added: &#8220;Send your pictures, age, name, maybe nationality Room can be used to work from like massage etc or just to live in.&#8221;One landlord told the BBC: &#8220;I was thinking once a week, something like that, I m happy as long as there s sex involved.&#8221;Another said: &#8220;As far as the apartment s concerned, it s as if we re flatmates. It s all the bills, the rent, free.&#8221;But he added: &#8220;You agree sort of like a couple of times a week, pop into my room sort of thing.&#8221;A landlord who defended the arrangement as a &#8220;friend with benefits&#8221; situation, added: &#8220;You can argue that high rent charged by landlords is taking advantage too.&#8220;There s no compulsion for them to do this. Everyone goes into it with their eyes wide open. I am the last type of person who d like to take advantage. Both sides have something the other person wants. I see it as a win-win situation.&#8221;He rejected claims it could be construed as sexual exploitation, saying that people working in jobs they did not enjoy was &#8220;like a form of prostitution&#8221;.Craigslist did not respond to requests for comment.Daily Mail
