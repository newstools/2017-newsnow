An angry group beat a young man with sticks and branches, pelted him with stones and half-bricks and kicked him in the face and head.On Friday, following the DA s march to Mary Fitzgerald Square in Newtown calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down, a number of marchers could still be seen walking around Johannesburg.One, wearing a DA flag wrapped around his neck, came within a block of Luthuli House, at a spot where a group of ANC supporters had gathered.Noticing him, the angry group started to chase him and threw stones at him. Members of the Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMCA) attempted to stop the mob from chasing the man down, but couldn t control the group of about 20 people who were after him.Eventually the group caught up with him and proceeded to beat him with sticks and branches, pelted him with stones and half-bricks and kicked him in the face and head.Luckily some sense prevailed and some MKMVA members intervened; an older Indian man wearing an ANC T-shirt managed to bring calm.The police also arrived with pepper spray and managed to get to the injured man.At this stage a few more stones were thrown, but the police managed to carry the man into a police vehicle. He was absolutely bewildered at this stage, bleeding from the head. He collapsed twice as they tried to pick him up.Here is the sequence of photographs that tell the story.WATCH ALSO: Footage of brutal attack of DA man by ANCYL members in Durban
