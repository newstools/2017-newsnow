It was not clear if he was the same man heard in the footage.The National daily cited Major General Khalil Al-Mansouri of the Dubai police&#8217;s criminal investigation department as saying that anybody convicted of animal abuse would face jail and heavy fines.Dr Susan Aylott, a volunteer at Animal Welfare Abu Dhabi, told the newspaper that this attack was not a rare act of cruelty against animals in the United Arab Emirates.&#8220;We have had several recent incidents like this, including that of a dog whose hind legs were tied and then skinned alive. The abuse has not stopped,&#8221; she said.
