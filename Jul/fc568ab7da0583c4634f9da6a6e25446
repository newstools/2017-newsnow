JOHANNESBURG &#8211; A Johannesburg man has been barred from smoking in front of his two sons after the boys&#8217; mother dragged him to court following vain attempts to stop him.The Health Department says Thursday&#8217;s High Court judgment forbidding the father from smoking in front of his children is a step in the right direction.The woman took her children&#8217;s father to court after he repeatedly smoked in front of his two sons, one of whom was recovering from a complicated foot operation.The court has now ordered the man not to smoke in the presence of his minor children for the duration of their visits.While the current law forbids drivers from smoking in their cars in the presence of minors, the department s Joe Maila says this ruling will strengthen tobacco laws. We believe that it s a really good thing that the law is on our side to suggest that indeed we are right to suggest that people should not be smoking or be exposing children, young people into smoking.
