A man has been critically hurt in a crash involving a train and a car at the Charlottedale Train Station in KwaDukuza.He&#8217;d been sitting in the back of the car &#8211; that&#8217;d been making its way over the railway tracks at a level crossing &#8211; at the time of the crash. &#8220;KwaDukuza fire department started the extrication of the gentleman while our paramedics treated him. He sustained massive head injuries, multiple fractures and vascular damage,&#8221; Herbst says. IPSS Medical Rescue&#8217;s Paul Herbst says the man was place on a ventilator before he was taken to hospital. A woman and another man travelling in the front of the vehicle suffered minor injuries last night when the fully loaded passenger train collided with the back of their car. It&#8217;s not clear at this stage why the vehicle hadn&#8217;t made it all the way across the tracks. Herbst says the car was found wedged under the train.&#8220;The vehicle damage at the back was extensive. It is a stopping point for the train to offload passengers,&#8221; he says.
