The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) has laid a charge of treason against Communications Minister, Faith Muthambi.OUTA&#8217;s Dominique Msibi says Muthambi has shared confidential information with the controversial Gupta family.&#8220;She knowingly and deliberately shared three confidential Cabinet memoranda, through emails with Tony Gupta, Duduzane Zuma and Sahara&#8217;s CEO Ashu Chawla. These people should never have been privy to any ministerial communication and policy discussions,&#8221; says Msibi. Article continues after adMsibi says Muthambi&#8217;s conduct is not what is expected from a Minister. &#8220;She appointed (Hlaudi) Motsoeneng, who was instrumental in funding the ANN7 Breakfast Show, although ANN7 is a competitor to SABC and for which the SABC paid R43 million to Infinity Media, a company affiliated to Duduzane Zuma and the Guptas. That is not the conduct we would expect of a Minister and we want her to be held accountable,&#8221; she says. Msibi says the police must investigate the charges so that Muthambi can stand trial.SOURCE ECR
