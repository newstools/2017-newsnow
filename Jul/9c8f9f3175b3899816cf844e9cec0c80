Narrating his ordeal he said, &#8220;I stopped after hearing a strange noise on my trailer and discovered that the mud flap on my second trailer was touching the wheels&#8221;&#8220;As I tried to pull it off the wheels the suspects suddenly appeared, one behind me holding a gun and another in front of me with a knife,&#8221;&#8220;The suspect behind me cocked his gun and ordered me to raise my hands and without thinking I charged towards the one with the knife in full speed. He had to jump off my way to let me escape but not before he could stab me on my left tricep,&#8221; he said.&#8220;I managed to escape and ran for about 50 metres and when I turned to see if the suspects were following I saw them casually walking away from the scene.&#8221;The suspects did not take anything from the victim.Masuku has since gone to the clinic where nurses told him that his wound was about 2cm deep and required 6 stitches to close it off. He counts himself lucky to escape with only a stab wound and recalls an incident where a motorist died while running away from robbers.He warned other truck drivers and motorists alike to be careful where they stop for whatever reason or they risk being another N2 breakdown robbery statistic.
