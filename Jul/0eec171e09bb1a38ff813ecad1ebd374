Two people have been killed and approximately twelve commuters left with injuries ranging from minor to severe in a collision involving a minibus taxi on the M4 Ruth First Highway this morning. At approximately 11:00 emergency services were called to the scene between the Broadway and Virginia off ramps of the north bound carriageway. On arrival on scene Paramedics found absolute mayhem as the minibus taxi was found on its side engulfed in flames. Paramedics and rescue workers worked fervently to remove the injured from the wreckage where they were traiged and treated on scene before being taken by various ambulances to nearby hospitals for further care. Two commuters unfortunately sustained fatal burn wounds in the incident and were declared deceased on arrival of Paramedics. The highway remained closed between the Swapo Road and Virginia off ramps whilst authorities conducted the necessary investigations. Reports from the scene suggest the minibus suffered a blow out of one of its tyres, causing it to overturn before bursting into flames, however all reports are speculative at this point. Authorities attended the scene and will investigate further.Source: Crisis Medical
