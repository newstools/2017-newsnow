A motorist has escaped serious injury following a devastating crash in Durban&#8217;s Reservoir Hills yesterday evening. Rescue Care paramedics received information at around 5pm that a bakkie crashed into a street-pole along Mountbatten Drive and was torn in two. Spokesperson Garrith Jamieson says paramedics headed out expecting the worst. &#8220;We received reports when we were called to say that a vehicle had torn in parts with people entrapped inside. We prepared ourselves and arriving on scene &#8211; you find the cab of the bakkie on the road and the other half down a bank near a house. &#8220;You expect to find absolute carnage. Surprisingly, it was found that the driver had sustained moderate injuries,&#8221; he said. Jamieson says the driver was treated and stabilised on scene before being taken to hospital for further care.
